## Warning
I am not a programmer. Programming is a hobby for me and I only have experience with basic PHP, HTML, MySQL and Javascript. Please do not judge my noodle messed up code too harshly. I tried to use ChatGPT as sparingly as possible, but since I'm a noob in Vanilla JS I had to ask for a few suggestions hence why the code might seem hectic and far from polished.

You don't know what Advent of Code is? Check out their [About page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about)!

## Languages used
Since I am a Javascript noob I decided to try and do this challenge in JS to get a better grasp of the language.

## Tools used
- Documentation (Look at what functions do)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (For quick language specific questions)
- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (To ask more specific question or ask about code readability and logic)
- [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) (to live test my code)
- [AoC Fornwall](https://aoc.fornwall.net/) (to get the expected result with someone else's working code to check whether I did wrong or not)

## Why do this ?
- Because it seems to be a fun challenge (not fun anymore after day 5 actually)
- To improve my coding skills and help me for my personal upcoming or ongooing projects

## Who are you?
I'm not a developper. I'm a linguist.
